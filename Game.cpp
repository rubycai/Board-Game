If the player gets an additional turn, you should display the board so someone looking at the screen can follow what's happening.
//If it was placed in one of the player's own holes that was empty just a moment before, and if the opponent's hole directly opposite from that hole is not empty, then that bean and all beans in the opponent's hole directly opposite from that hole are put into the players pot, and the turn ends. (This is a capture.) Notice that it is not a capture if the player's last bean ends up in an empty hole on the opponent's side.
//Whenever a turn ends with all of the holes on one side of the board empty (no matter whose turn ended), the game is over, and any beans in the other player's holes are put into that other player's pot. The winner is then the player with the most beans in his pot.
